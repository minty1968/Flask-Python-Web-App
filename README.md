# Flask Python Web App

## Getting Started

Installation is recommended with Pipenv:

```shell


```

## Working so far

```shell
    UK Lottery numbers are generated using python random module, each draw type also displays what is stored in a
    MongoDB collection, collection names are:

         lotto
         lotto-hotpicks
         euromillions
         euromillions-hotpicks
         set-for-life
         thunderball 

    If you run one of my other python scripts called lottery-analyser.py, it will download the latest draw results file
    and make a few modifiecations then write to a MongoDB collection which will work with this app.
```


This app is still under development, this page will be updated once the app is complete.
